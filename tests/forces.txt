    Example of function object specification:
    \verbatim
    forces1
    {
        type        forces;
        libs        (forces);
        ...
        log         yes;
        writeFields yes;
        patches     (walls);

        binData
        {
            nBin        20;
            direction   (1 0 0);
            cumulative  yes;
        }
    }
    \endverbatim

    Where the entries comprise:
    \table
        Property     | Description             | Required    | Default value
        type         | Type name: forces       | yes         |
        log          | Write force data to standard output | no | no
        writeFields  | Write the force and moment fields | no | no
        patches      | Patches included in the forces calculation | yes |
        p            | Pressure field name     | no          | p
        U            | Velocity field name     | no          | U
        rho          | Density field name (see below) | no   | rho
        CofR         | Centre of rotation (see below) | no   |
        porosity     | flag to include porosity contributions | no | no
        directForceDensity | Force density supplied directly (see below)|no|no
        fD           | Name of force density field (see below) | no | fD
    \endtable

    Bin data is optional, but if the dictionary is present, the entries must
    be defined according o
    \table
        nBin         | number of data bins     | yes         |
        direction    | direction along which bins are defined | yes |
        cumulative   | bin data accumulated with incresing distance | yes |
    \endtable
